# Genetic algorithm discovery of worst case Go sort inputs powered by AWS Batch and Docker

This post will give a walk thru of the following concepts:
* What are genetic algorithms
* How to apply genetic algorithms to black box function inputs
* How sorting works in Go
* Architecting a genetic algorithm in Go
* Deploying and running a genetic algorithm at a large scale using AWS Batch and ECS

By the end of this, you should know everything you need to quickly execute
custom, large scale genetic algorithms using AWS and Go.
